/// A peer-to-peer transport for the Mere browser.
///
/// `Transport` provides authenticated, encrypted bidirectional streams between
/// peers identified by [`PeerID`]. The reference implementation will be
/// iroh-backed (Phase 2C work); an in-memory backend for tests is Phase 2B
/// work.
///
/// ## Generic over implementation
///
/// Consumers (`murm`, `gemot`, etc.) take a `Transport` as a generic
/// parameter rather than `Box<dyn Transport>`, so the same code works
/// against real iroh in production and against an in-memory transport in
/// tests:
///
/// ```ignore
/// async fn open_cable_stream<T: Transport>(
///     transport: &T,
///     peer: PeerID,
/// ) -> Result<T::Stream, TransportError> {
///     transport
///         .connect(peer, Alpn::new("mere/cable/v1"))
///         .await
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The associated `Stream` type implements [`tokio::io::AsyncRead`] and
/// [`tokio::io::AsyncWrite`], so consumers can use standard tokio I/O
/// patterns (length-prefixed framing, line-delimited reads, codec layers,
/// etc.) without caring about the underlying transport.
///
/// ## Send + Sync + 'static
///
/// All trait bounds (`Send + Sync` on the trait, `Send + Unpin + 'static` on
/// `Stream`, and `+ Send` on returned futures) are present so transport
/// objects can be shared across `tokio::spawn`-ed tasks. This matches the
/// expected runtime topology where a single transport is used by many
/// concurrent protocol handlers.
pub trait Transport: Send + Sync {
    /// The bidirectional stream type returned by `connect` and `accept`.
