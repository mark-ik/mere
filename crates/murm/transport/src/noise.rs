//! Noise: an encrypted, mutually authenticated **session layer** that composes
//! over any byte stream.
//!
//! ## What this is, and what it is not
//!
//! This is not a carrier competing with the iroh lane. iroh is the byte plane:
//! it owns QUIC, NAT traversal, relays, and discovery, and nothing here moves
//! bytes off it. What the [Noise Protocol Framework](https://noiseprotocol.org/)
//! adds is a second, *application-layer* handshake that runs **inside** a
//! stream the carrier already opened.
//!
//! [`handshake`] is generic over `S: AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Unpin`, which is
//! the whole design. Hand it an iroh stream and you get Noise over iroh; hand
//! it a TCP stream and you get the standalone case ([`NoiseListener`]); hand it
//! a Reticulum link and you get Noise over the mesh. The layer never learns
//! what is underneath it.
//!
//! ## What composing it over iroh buys
//!
//! **Zero trust through relays.** An iroh connection through a relay is
//! encrypted to the relay's satisfaction of QUIC, but the plane it traverses is
//! not ours. A Noise session inside it is opaque to everything between the two
//! endpoints, including infrastructure we run.
//!
//! **Layered identity.** This is the part worth being precise about, because
//! the two keys answer different questions:
//!
//! - The **carrier identity** (iroh's endpoint key, an Ed25519 public half)
//!   answers *where do packets go*. It is routing and traversal machinery, it
//!   is visible to relays, and it is long-lived because reachability depends on
//!   its stability.
//! - The **Noise identity** (whatever keypair is passed to [`handshake`])
//!   answers *who is speaking*. It can be a persona, one agent acting for a
//!   persona, or an identity that exists only for this session.
//!
//! Collapsing them is a choice, not a default: pass the same keypair and you
//! get one identity in two places. Pass [`Ed25519Keypair::derive_child`] or
//! [`Ed25519Keypair::generate`] and the peer learns who it is talking to
//! without learning which node, at which address, it reached them on.
//!
//! ## Two things this layer defines, because Noise does not
//!
//! **Framing.** Noise messages are discrete and capped at 65535 bytes; a
//! stream has no message boundaries. The specification leaves the
//! reconciliation to the application, so [`stream`] defines a 2-byte big-endian
//! length prefix, the conventional choice. Ours to make: both ends are this
//! code. It is not licence to guess another protocol's framing.
//!
//! **Identity.** Noise proves an X25519 static key; Mere's [`PeerID`] is an
//! Ed25519 key. So each side sends an identity proof as its first transport
//! message, signing this session's handshake hash. See [`keys`].
//!
//! ## The suite
//!
//! [`NOISE_PARAMS`]: `Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2b`. `XX` is the
//! mutual-unknown pattern: neither side needs the other's key in advance, both
//! transmit theirs encrypted during the handshake, and both end up holding the
//! other's proven static key. That is trust-on-first-use as a protocol
//! property rather than as a workaround.
//!
//! ## On BLAKE2b, since our stack is BLAKE3
//!
//! The hash is part of the suite name and is **not negotiated**, so both ends
//! must use BLAKE2b or they simply do not interoperate. BLAKE3 is not in the
//! Noise specification and `snow` does not offer it. This is not a gap to
//! close: the two hashes do different jobs. BLAKE3 is our *content addressing*
//! choice, which is ours precisely because it never appears on a wire. BLAKE2b
//! here is *wire description*, which is the peer's to dictate. Unifying them
//! would mean either breaking interoperability or letting a foreign protocol
//! choose our content-addressing hash.
