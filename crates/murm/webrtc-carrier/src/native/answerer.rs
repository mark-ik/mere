//! The native answerer: bind a socket, answer one offer, serve one channel.
//!
//! The browser offers and the native host answers, which is why this half is an
//! answerer and not a symmetric peer. It does three things and stops:
//!
//! 1. binds a UDP socket and declares it as an ICE host candidate;
//! 2. turns one SDP offer into one SDP answer;
//! 3. hands the negotiated `Rtc` to the Sans-IO driver.
//!
//! Signalling is deliberately absent. C1 says to use copy/paste or a loopback
//! fixture, so [`answer`](Answerer::answer) takes and returns SDP *text* and
//! has no opinion about how it travels. A Worker relaying that text is not a
//! carrier fact, which is the rule the plan's boundaries section states.
//!
//! ## Interface discovery is the caller's
//!
//! str0m states plainly that it has no discovery of local or NATed addresses,
//! and this crate adds none: a dependency that enumerates interfaces would be
//! the first thing in here that cannot build for the browser half. Binding to a
//! concrete address gives you a candidate for free; binding to an unspecified
//! one requires [`AnswererConfig::advertise`], and binding to an unspecified
//! address with nothing to advertise is an error rather than a session that
//! silently never connects.
