//! Plan §4's backpressure requirement is stateful — "stop sending at/above
//! `high_water_bytes`... resume only once it crosses `low_water_bytes`" is a
//! hysteresis, not a single comparison — so it needs somewhere to live
//! between calls. [`SendGate`] is that somewhere, and it is deliberately
//! generic over how the current queue depth is read, via
//! [`BufferedAmountSource`], rather than reaching into a
//! `web_sys::RtcDataChannel` itself. That is what makes the decision logic
//! checkable with a bare `u32` in a unit test instead of a peer connection.
