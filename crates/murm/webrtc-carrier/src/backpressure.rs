//! The queue policy both runtimes obey.
//!
//! C1 requires that a sender stop above a high-water mark and resume only once
//! the queue drains past a *lower* one. The two marks are the whole point: a
//! single threshold oscillates, because the queue sits at the mark and every
//! completed write re-crosses it. The gap is hysteresis, and it is why this is
//! a type rather than a pair of loose constants.
//!
//! This lives in the shared core, not in either adapter, because the browser
//! and the native host must agree on the numbers. The browser reads
//! `RTCDataChannel.bufferedAmount`; the native side reads its own outbound
//! queue depth. Different sources, same policy.
