# Genet compatibility

Cambium consumes Genet through published seam packages. `cambium-nematic`
adds reactive projections over Errand's portable smolweb ASTs; Genet's retained
document runtime remains in `genet-documents`.

| Package | Version | Current source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `layout-dom-api` | 0.1.0 | crates.io and sibling path |

| `genet-scripted-dom` | 0.1.0 | crates.io and sibling path |

The published Cambium stack is `meristem 0.1.0`, `sprigging 0.2.0`,
`cambium 0.3.0`, `cambium-winit 0.2.0`, and `cambium-nematic 0.3.0`.
Cambium Winit's 0.3.0 source is versioned with the workspace, but its new
accessibility host depends on `genet-layout`, which does not yet have a
standalone crates.io release. Keep its published line at 0.2.0 until that
dependency closes rather than shipping a package that cannot resolve.
Cambium Nematic's release boundary is Cambium plus the protocol AST package,
without Genet's layout or rendering engine.

## Custom-leaf protocol

Cambium emits Genet's neutral `<custom-leaf>` element and related attribute
vocabulary. Genet temporarily accepts `<chisel-leaf>` as a read-side
compatibility alias for older documents.

## Direction rule

Cambium may depend on Genet seam crates. Genet engine crates must remain free
of Cambium, Meristem, and Sprigging dependencies. Reference applications such as
Pelt may depend on all three.
