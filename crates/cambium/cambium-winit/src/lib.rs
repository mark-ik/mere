//! Platform integration for Cambium applications hosted with winit.
//!
//! Window presentation remains the host's responsibility. This crate translates
//! winit's keyboard vocabulary into Cambium events and maps its wheel deltas to
//! scroll axes.
//!
//! Deliberately thin, and thin on purpose: it depends on `cambium` and `winit`
//! and nothing else, so it can be published and reached from a consumer that
//! resolves the catalog from the registry. The accessibility host moved to
//! `cambium-winit-a11y` on 2026-07-26 for exactly that reason -- it needs the
//! laid-out genet DOM and the platform adapter, neither of which can be
//! published, and holding them here made this crate unpublishable too. A host
//! that wants a screen-reader tree takes both crates.
