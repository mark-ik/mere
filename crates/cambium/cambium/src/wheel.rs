//! The native wheel/scroll event view: [`on_wheel`]`(child, handler)`.
//!
//! The scroll foundation under scrollable content (and, later, the orrery's
//! wheel-pan / Ctrl-zoom). It is the [`on_pointer`](crate::on_pointer) pattern
//! for a discrete scroll notch: the view records its routing path in
//! [`GenetCtx`]'s wheel registry keyed by its DOM node, and the runner's
//! [`dispatch_wheel`](crate::GenetAppRunner::dispatch_wheel) routes a
//! [`WheelEvent`] down that path.
//!
//! Unlike pointer there is no **capture**: a wheel notch is one-shot, so each
//! event resolves its own target by the ancestor walk (the innermost
//! scroll-handling element under the cursor). A single registered handler per
//! node receives the event (no capture/bubble split — the wheel routes straight
//! to the resolved target).
