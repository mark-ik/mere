//! Compatibility wrapper for the original click-only overlay menu.
//!
//! New command and context menus should use [`crate::command_menu`], which adds
//! menu semantics, shared keyboard state, disabled reasons, and submenus. This
//! wrapper remains for source compatibility and for completion popups whose
//! keyboard state is still owned by their editor.
//!
//! A small reusable overlay menu: a positioned vertical list of labelled rows with one
//! marked active and each clicking a host handler. It is the shape every Genet host
//! reaches for — a completion popup, a slash / command menu, a context menu, a picker —
//! composed from the existing [`overlay_at`](crate::overlay_at) primitive so it is pure
//! Tier-1 CSS/native views (no leaf). The host owns the state (which items, the query,
//! the selected index) and the keyboard; this only renders.
//!
//! Rows carry the classes `menu-row` and `menu-row-active`, and the container `menu`, so a
//! host stylesheet themes them.
